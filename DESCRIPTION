Description: BBCAnalyzer is a package for visualizing the relative or
        absolute number of bases, deletions and insertions at defined
        positions in sequence alignment data available as bam files in
        comparison to the reference bases. Markers for the relative
        base frequencies, the mean quality of the detected bases, known
        mutations or polymorphisms and variants called in the data may
        additionally be included in the plots.
